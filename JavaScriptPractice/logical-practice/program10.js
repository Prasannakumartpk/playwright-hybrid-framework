console.log("5" - 2);

console.log("6" * "2");

/* "5" - 2

The - operator is not defined for strings, so JavaScript tries to convert the string "5" into a number.

"5" → 5

5 - 2 = 3

✅ Output:

3

"6" * "2"

The * operator also expects numbers.

Both "6" and "2" get converted to numbers.

6 * 2 = 12

✅ Output:

12*/
